# My Collection of Data Science Articles
I like to read a variety of data science articles to expand my knowledge as well as apply it for real-world problems. But it is extremely difficult to remember every article. Thus, I want to organize the articles so that it is easier for me to refer back to them in the future.

In particular, I want to sort, summarize, and write down key takeaways from the article. I found Github issues is a perfect tool for this. I created this [machine-learning-articles repo](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/machine-learning-articles/) to organize my data science articles with Github issues.

## Data Analysis
### I Scraped more than 1k Top Machine Learning Github Profiles and this is what I Found
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/Data-science/tree/master/visualization/github) [![View on Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-View%20on%20Medium-red?logo=medium)](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-scraped-more-than-1k-top-machine-learning-github-profiles-and-this-is-what-i-found-1ab4fb0c0474?sk=68156d6b1c05614d356645728fe02584)

When searching the keyword “machine learning” on Github, I found 246,632 machine learning repositories. Since these are top repositories in machine learning, I expect the owners and the contributors of these repositories to be experts or competent in machine learning. Thus, I decided to extract the profiles of these users to gain some interesting insights into their background as well as statistics.

### What I Learned from Scraping 15k Data Science Articles on Medium
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/Data-science/tree/master/visualization/medium_articles) [![View on Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-View%20on%20Medium-red?logo=medium)](https://khuyentran1476.medium.com/what-i-learned-from-scraping-15k-data-science-articles-on-medium-98a5f252d0aa?sk=65e4e5595844e7543cd70948947cfd71)

As a data science writer, I wonder:
   * What factors make an article receive a high number of claps
   * What is the average number of claps? Some articles I came across have 100 or even 1000 claps. Is that a typical number of claps for a Data Science article?
   * Which titles are most used by data science articles?
   * What is the ideal reading time for a good article?
   * Will publishing on the weekdays give more claps than the weekends?

To answer these questions, I scraped all data science articles on Medium published within the last year.
