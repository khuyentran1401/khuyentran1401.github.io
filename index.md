[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/Real-or-Not)

Predict whether a tweet is about a disaster ot not. Preprocess with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and perform model training with various models and techniques including: Tf-Idf, Tf-Idf with Ngrams (words and characters), SelectKbest, Binary Vectorizer, Word2Vec, Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network with PyTorch. Achieve a f1-score of 80%.

## Data Science
### Classify Handwritten Digits with Implementation of Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/MNIST-gradient-descent)

**Description**: This is my final project of my numerical optimzation class. The task is to implement logistic regression and gradient descent to classify images of handwritten digits. Through this project, I gained a much better understanding of how to use gradient descent when the function representing the data is not convex

**Development**: The mathematical formulation and the logic of this projects could be found [here](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/MNIST-gradient-descent/blob/master/formulation.pdf).

**Description**: Perform simple prediction of world population using linear regression using different data science tools. The target of this project is to learn the complete data science workflow and how to integrate different data science tools into the workflow.

**Tools**: Amazon RDS, Amazon EC2, MySQL, Talend ETL, Tableau, Python

**Result**: 0.994

**Motivation**: My roomate and I were discussing about the correlation between the sun and depression. To prove my point that less sun is correlated to depression rate, I gather the data to support my hypothesis.

**Tools**: Beautiful Soup, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
