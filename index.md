Preprocess with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and perform model training with various models and techniques including: Tf-Idf, Tf-Idf with Ngrams (words and characters), SelectKbest, Binary Vectorizer, Word2Vec, Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network with PyTorch. Achieve a f1-score of 80%.
